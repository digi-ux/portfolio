									</header>
									<p><strong>This project showcases the typography and layout techniques used in a travel magazine.</strong></p>
								<br>
								
								<p><strong>Description:</strong> This project is from the course <em>Typography, Form, and Graphic Tools</em> at Linnaeus University in Sweden.
									The task was to design a magazine following typographic principles, selecting appropriate fonts, applying them in various contexts, and ensuring effective interaction between text and images.</p>
									<p><strong>Objective:</strong> 
										In this project, I have focused on how typography impacts the user experience and how it can improve readability, create visual hierarchy, and strengthen the brand's identity. By using different font styles, weights, and sizes, I have ensured that users can easily navigate and absorb information in an intuitive way.</p>
	
									<p><strong>Tools:</strong> This project was created using <em>Adobe InDesign & Photoshop</em>.</p>
									<p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Nature lovers, hikers, and anyone interested in exploring new destinations.</p>
									<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The result is a magazine called <em>Terra Nova</em>, which showcases stunning travel destinations and provides readers with an immersive visual and textual experience of nature's beauty (see Fig. 1).</p>

									<h2>Design</h2>
									<p>The starting point for the magazine is meant to reflect my interest in nature and the goal of the magazine is to share travel inspiration for the places where hiking enthusiasts can experience nature.
									The magazine's layout consists of images and text, where some images extend across the entire page while others share the page with articles about different travel destinations.
									The name of the magazine <em>Terra Nova</em>, is designed in capital letters with the font <em>Encode Sans SC</em> and adorns the cover to convey a modern and slightly adventurous feeling to the reader (see Fig. 2).</p>
									
									<figure class="image main half-width">

									</figure>
									<br>
									<p>This project showcases a magazine layout designed to inspire travel enthusiasts. The magazine aims to highlight stunning travel destinations and provide readers with an immersive visual and textual experience of nature's beauty. The target audience includes nature lovers, hikers, and anyone interested in exploring new destinations.</p>
									<p>On the cover, the reader is welcomed by a stunning view of a hotel and a small castle nestled in a valley, representing the natural beauty of the Alps. A tranquil body of water flows through the landscape, crossed by a bridge and surrounded by lush green forests. The image also features a mirrored reflection of the buildings and trees. The way the water captures this reflection caught my eye, adding an extra dimension to the scene, which led to this particular image being chosen as the cover of my magazine (see Fig. 2).</p>
									<figure class="image main half-width">

										<figcaption id="desc2">Fig. 3. The cover image showing a mirror image of buildings and forest.</figcaption>
									</figure>
									<br>
									
									<p>The first spread offers an overwhelming image of a valley seen from a mountain, the image is meant to represent one of the destinations. On the next page, one half of the page is combined with an image of a person standing on rocks and looking out over the view in the background, while the other half of the page presents an informative article text about the first destination that the magazine presents (see Fig. 3).</p>
									<figure class="image main half-width">
										<img src="images/spread1.jpg" class="half-width" alt="Spread 1" aria-describedby="desc3" />
										<figcaption id="desc3">Fig. 4. A spread view: Page 1 (left) and Page 2 (right).</figcaption>
									</figure>
									<br>
									
									<p>Page three introduces three images, where the first is a smaller version of the cover image. The two other images, placed in parallel to the right of the first, create a visual harmony in my opinion.
										Page four presents a full-length image of a serpentine road through a spruce forest, captured from above. This image is meant to represent the path down to the valley shown in the cover image (see Fig. 4).</p>
									<figure class="image main half-width">
										<img src="images/spread2.jpg" class="half-width" alt="Spread 2" aria-describedby="desc4" />
										<figcaption id="desc4">Fig. 5. A spread view: Page 3 (left) and Page 4 (right).</figcaption>
									</figure>
									<br>
									<p>Pages five and six follow up with two images that divide the page with matching article texts. The images, which dominate the top half of each page, show people looking down from a mountain into a forest valley. The body text, written in "Minion Pro," and the headings, created with "Helvetica Neue (OTF)," complement each other and create a balanced typographic hierarchy (see Fig. 5).</p>

									<h1>Magazine Design Justification</h1>
									<br>

									<section>
										<h2>Images</h2>
										<p><strong>Justification:</strong> The images in the magazine play a central role in conveying the beauty of nature and inspiring travel. The use of full-page images provides readers with a grand and immersive view of the locations, while half-page images allow for the inclusion of article text. Nielsen (2010, pp. 292–293) argues that using fewer large images is generally more effective than including many small ones. My use of different image sizes and perspectives, particularly by incorporating both overview shots and close-up details, creates variation and visual richness.</p>
									</section>
									
									<br>
									
									<section>
										<h2>Typography</h2>
										<p><strong>Justification:</strong> Koblanck (2018, p. 176) states that a good starting point is to choose a serif and a sans-serif font that complement each other well in both large and small sizes.</p>
										<p>The typefaces <em>Encode Sans SC</em>, <em>Helvetica Neue</em>, and <em>Minion Pro</em> were carefully selected because they offer multiple variations to effectively communicate the magazine's content.</p>
										<p>I believe that <em>Encode Sans SC</em> in the cover title gives a modern and adventurous impression, while <em>Helvetica Neue</em>, used for headings and captions, feels both readable and contemporary. <em>Minion Pro</em> for body text enhances readability and provides a timeless feel.</p>
										<p>Furthermore, French (2022) recommends choosing typefaces based on their designer, as this can help maintain a cohesive visual identity. In my case, I discovered that one of the creators of <em>Helvetica Neue</em> also designed a typeface called <em>Walbaum</em>. However, since <em>Walbaum</em> is a paid font, I opted for a similar alternative—<em>Minion Pro</em>, which is included in Adobe InDesign.</p>
									</section>
									
									<br>
									
									<section>
										<h2>Layout</h2>
										<p><strong>Justification:</strong> The consistent use of full-page images to introduce locations, combined with half-page images and text, creates a structured and visually appealing layout. By placing smaller images in parallel, such as on page three, an interesting dynamic and connection between the images is achieved.</p>
										<p>Nielsen (2010, p. 313) emphasizes the importance of maintaining a cohesive layout. The layout structure of my magazine balances large and small images throughout, depending on the amount of article text on each page.</p>
